Question 1

Arithmetic Operators in Java
Instructions:

Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs arithmetic operations on them using the arithmetic operators (sum, difference, product, quotient, remainder) in Java.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();

        int sum = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);

        int diff = num1 - num2;
        System.out.println("Difference: " + diff);

        int mul = num1 * num2;
        System.out.println("Product: " + mul);

        int div = num1 / num2;
        System.out.println("Quotient: " + div);

        int rem = num1 % num2;
        System.out.println("Remainder: " + rem);
    }
}

7. Arithmetic Operators in Java
Instructions:

Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs arithmetic operations on them using the arithmetic operators (sum, difference, product, quotient, remainder) in Java.

Examples:

# Examples: 
1. int num1 = 10; 
   int num2 = 5; 
   int sum = num1 + num2; 
   System.out.println(sum); // Output: 15  
Sample Input & Output:

Sample Input:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Sample Output:
Sum: 15
Difference: 5
Product: 50
Quotient: 2
Remainder: 0
Hints:
1. Use the Scanner class to read input from the user.
2. Declare variables to store the input values and the results of the arithmetic operations.
3. Use the appropriate arithmetic operators to perform the calculations.
4. Print the results using the System.out.println() method.
5. Remember to handle division by zero when calculating the quotient.

Your answer

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();

        int sum = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);

        int diff = num1 - num2;
        System.out.println("Difference: " + diff);

        int mul = num1 * num2;
        System.out.println("Product: " + mul);

        int div = num1 / num2;
        System.out.println("Quotient: " + div);

        int rem = num1 % num2;
        System.out.println("Remainder: " + rem);
    }
}


Question 2

Logical Operators in Java
Instructions:

Write a program that takes two boolean values as input and performs logical operations (AND, OR) on them using the logical operators& print the result.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class LogicalOperatorsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        boolean input1 = scanner.nextBoolean();
        boolean input2 = scanner.nextBoolean();

        System.out.println(input1 && input2);
        System.out.println(input1 || input2);
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}


Question 3

Relational Operators in Java
Instructions:

Write a program that takes two integers as input and compares them using relational operators. Print 'true' if the first integer is greater than the second integer, and 'false' otherwise.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class RelationalOperatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println(num1 > num2);
        scanner.close();
    }
}

Question 4

Check Number Parity
Write a program in java to check whether the given number is an even number or not using if else statement.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num = scanner.nextInt();
        if(num % 2 == 0){
            System.out.println("No is Even");
        }else{
            System.out.println("No is odd");
        }

    }
}
